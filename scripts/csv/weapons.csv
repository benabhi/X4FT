turret_gen_m_scrapbeam_01_mk1_macro,Scrap Tractor,turret,m,1,"The Scrap Tractor employs an array of graviton beams to leash an object to a towing ship. The beams automatically and independently adjust their focus to further enhance the gravitational forces as the distance between the two objects becomes greater, resulting in an elasticity effect. All resistance is not futile, however, since severe disruptions, such as being hit by weapon fire, will cause the connection to break. Likewise, the graviton beams are inherently unstable until the artificial gravitational field is fully engaged, and even minor distortions such as the lingering effects of depleted shields, or electrical currents behind the target's hull, will prompt them to lose focus. Because of these limitations, the Scrap Tractor is mainly used to tow ship wrecks below a certain size limit, to avoid exceeding the maximum energy output of the weapon mount. For reasons which are not entirely clear, the connection remains stable during Jump Gate traversals.\n\nThe modern Scrap Tractor has only recently been made available to the wider Gate Network by the Alliance of the Word. The Alliance received the designs for it by deep space messenger drone, sent from the Avarice system, which was once thought lost. It is, however, by no means an entirely new technology. Before the Terran Conflict, and even up until the Gate Shutdown, a predecessor of this weapon - or rather tool - was occasionally deployed by opportunistic scavengers, looking to profit from the ongoing destruction of advanced warships in conflict zones.

Over distance, however, the damage output falls off steeply, and at maximum range barely matches that of a standard M Bolt Repeater turret. Although the Erlking is perfectly capable of defending itself at a distance, the high damage output of its turrets at short range makes it much more dangerous at close proximity, meaning that aggressive manoeuvres by the Erlking's pilot are rewarded. This exceptional performance is attributed to the Erlking's power core, from which the turrets draw energy.\n\nBoso Ta was particularly keen to go into detail about how this turret manages to rapidly access the power core, for only the blink of an eye at a time, before just as rapidly cutting the connection, thereby preventing an energy draining feedback loop capable of destroying the ship.

Its pin-point accuracy and high projectile speed make it an excellent choice for fighting small and fast targets, handling fragile lockboxes, and for dealing with deployables like mines and laser towers. Often initially scoffed at for its comparatively low damage output, its slow heat generation and sublime cooling result in a steady stream of disruptive fire, which in turn rewards pilots who can stay on target for an extended period. Faced with larger enemies, the Pulse Laser does not become obsolete as quickly as one might expect. Used in greater numbers, it can still be a formidable choice against frigates and corvettes, though an upgrade to a larger weapon mount may be advisable to maintain a level playing field. The Pulse Laser remains the preferred choice of commanders who favour versatility over optimisation against specific opponents, or who have little trust in the aim of their subordinates.\n\nThe technology behind the Pulse Laser is advanced and efficient. Within a shielded chamber, microscopic fragments of matter are superheated and accelerated by a pulsed neodymium laser. The weapon was originally designed by the Ministry of Finance to provide a robust loadout for their escort fleets, without having to invest time and resources into the maintenance of a well-rounded combined arms setup. Over time, and thanks to the Teladi Company's aggressive marketing, it has been adopted as the number one weapon of convenience by all other former members of the Community of Planets.\n\nThe Mk2 variant sports a slightly longer burst.

Heat, therefore, accumulates more quickly than for its non-Terran counterpart, but because of the supreme energy efficiency of the underlying mechanism, overheating remains an unlikely event. As such, pilots who use this version of the Pulse Laser are still rewarded for maintaining pressure on their opponents, and remaining on target for the entirety of the fight.\n\nAfter the Realignment, the Terran Protectorate was quick to survey the military capabilities of its potential rivals in the new Jump Gate network, and soon acquired blueprints for the most widespread weapon of the time - the Pulse Laser. Noticing its versatility and beautiful simplicity, the well-oiled machine of the Terran military-industrial complex did what it had always done best: made extensive adjustments to auspicious technology to give it a distinct Terran identity and to prevent reverse-engineering.

Its drawbacks, slow projectile speed and fire rate, made worse by high heat generation, can make landing hits as challenging as it is important. This results in its predominant use being against capital ships, where swarms of fighters deploy Plasma Cannons to great success. Unlike short ranged weapons such as the Shard Battery and the Split Tau Accelerator, which outperform it in damage output and are more suited to attacking capital ships from a blind spot, the Plasma Cannon's greatest advantage is its range. Skilled pilots are also able to hunt down smaller targets efficiently, either by deploying the Plasma Cannon at short range or by predicting the courses of the projectile and target. Similarly, skilled pilots are also able to evade and avoid being hit by such attempts.\n\nThe Plasma Cannon was developed during the early days of the Paranid Civil War, by the Holy Order of the Pontifex, building upon the High Energy Plasma Thrower.

Compared to the Bolt Repeater, the Proton Barrage offers higher damage output and projectile speed, but forfeits some of its range. While providing more damage in total, the Barrage has a lower fire rate and focusses on delivering more powerful individual projectiles during its long bursts. Its main downsides are its compatibility restriction that limits it to Terran ship designs, and the fact that it is twice as expensive when compared to the weaker Commonwealth Bolt Repeater. The Proton Barrage is a generalist weapon which performs well against most reasonable targets.\n\nWith the reconnection of the Commonwealth, the Terran Secret Service acquired the Bolt Repeater blueprint, enabling Terran engineers to develop it into the Proton Barrage.

weapon_gen_m_laser_01_mk2_macro,Pulse Laser Mk2,weapon,m,2,"Many experienced pilots fondly remember the affordable and reliable Pulse Laser as their first weapon. Its pin-point accuracy and high projectile speed make it an excellent choice for fighting small and fast targets, handling fragile lockboxes, and for dealing with deployables like mines and laser towers. Often initially scoffed at for its comparatively low damage output, its slow heat generation and sublime cooling result in a steady stream of disruptive fire, which in turn rewards pilots who can stay on target for an extended period. Faced with larger enemies, the Pulse Laser does not become obsolete as quickly as one might expect. Used in greater numbers, it can still be a formidable choice against frigates and corvettes, though an upgrade to a larger weapon mount may be advisable to maintain a level playing field. The Pulse Laser remains the preferred choice of commanders who favour versatility over optimisation against specific opponents, or who have little trust in the aim of their subordinates.\n\nThe technology behind the Pulse Laser is advanced and efficient. Within a shielded chamber, microscopic fragments of matter are superheated and accelerated by a pulsed neodymium laser. The weapon was originally designed by the Ministry of Finance to provide a robust loadout for their escort fleets, without having to invest time and resources into the maintenance of a well-rounded combined arms setup. Over time, and thanks to the Teladi Company's aggressive marketing, it has been adopted as the number one weapon of convenience by all other former members of the Community of Planets.\n\nThe Mk2 variant sports a slightly longer burst.

It dispenses with the use of clips for short bursts, and puts a greater emphasis on the power of the individual projectiles. Despite the weapon's reduced effective range, the microscopic particles are accelerated faster and reach their targets much quicker. Heat, therefore, accumulates more quickly than for its non-Terran counterpart, but because of the supreme energy efficiency of the underlying mechanism, overheating remains an unlikely event. As such, pilots who use this version of the Pulse Laser are still rewarded for maintaining pressure on their opponents, and remaining on target for the entirety of the fight.\n\nAfter the Realignment, the Terran Protectorate was quick to survey the military capabilities of its potential rivals in the new Jump Gate network, and soon acquired blueprints for the most widespread weapon of the time - the Pulse Laser. Noticing its versatility and beautiful simplicity, the well-oiled machine of the Terran military-industrial complex did what it had always done best: made extensive adjustments to auspicious technology to give it a distinct Terran identity and to prevent reverse-engineering. The result still behaves like a Pulse Laser in practice.

However, the ejection of multiple projectiles at once requires a wider barrel aperture, a larger spacing between shots, and generates a higher energy drain. When it comes to its damage output, the Shard Battery has been compared to the Plasma Cannon, but it offers a slightly different range of applications. Skilled military pilots may occasionally make use of this weapon against small targets in an attempt to end the fight quickly, but it is generally agreed upon that one should try to avoid these situations. The Shard Battery reaches its fullest potential against larger and slower targets such as M-sized ships, which cannot as easily evade its projectiles. It is also especially effective against capital ship surface elements, provided that the pilot can find an opportunity to target them from the blind spots of nearby turrets.\n\nThe Mk2 variant fires fewer shards at a higher speed but with a shorter interval.

This resulted in weapons such as the Blast Mortar: surprisingly simple to produce, at least from the perspective of the superior Paranid intellect, yet at the same time brutally effective. Though they were initially ordered to build stronger beams for their visual effect, the priest engineers put their faith in what they most believed in: local maxima in the parameter space. Like a paradise yet untouched by mortal interference, the Blast Mortar works in perfect equilibrium as long as its careful calibration isn't disturbed.

Its pin-point accuracy and high projectile speed make it an excellent choice for fighting small and fast targets, handling fragile lockboxes, and for dealing with deployables like mines and laser towers. Often initially scoffed at for its comparatively low damage output, its slow heat generation and sublime cooling result in a steady stream of disruptive fire, which in turn rewards pilots who can stay on target for an extended period. Faced with larger enemies, the Pulse Laser does not become obsolete as quickly as one might expect. Used in greater numbers, it can still be a formidable choice against frigates and corvettes, though an upgrade to a larger weapon mount may be advisable to maintain a level playing field. The Pulse Laser remains the preferred choice of commanders who favour versatility over optimisation against specific opponents, or who have little trust in the aim of their subordinates.\n\nThe technology behind the Pulse Laser is advanced and efficient. Within a shielded chamber, microscopic fragments of matter are superheated and accelerated by a pulsed neodymium laser. The weapon was originally designed by the Ministry of Finance to provide a robust loadout for their escort fleets, without having to invest time and resources into the maintenance of a well-rounded combined arms setup. Over time, and thanks to the Teladi Company's aggressive marketing, it has been adopted as the number one weapon of convenience by all other former members of the Community of Planets.\n\nThe Mk2 variant sports a slightly longer burst.

Heat, therefore, accumulates more quickly than for its non-Terran counterpart, but because of the supreme energy efficiency of the underlying mechanism, overheating remains an unlikely event. As such, pilots who use this version of the Pulse Laser are still rewarded for maintaining pressure on their opponents, and remaining on target for the entirety of the fight.\n\nAfter the Realignment, the Terran Protectorate was quick to survey the military capabilities of its potential rivals in the new Jump Gate network, and soon acquired blueprints for the most widespread weapon of the time - the Pulse Laser. Noticing its versatility and beautiful simplicity, the well-oiled machine of the Terran military-industrial complex did what it had always done best: made extensive adjustments to auspicious technology to give it a distinct Terran identity and to prevent reverse-engineering. The result still behaves like a Pulse Laser in practice.

Its decent blast radius, added to the already high damage per projectile, make it an excellent choice for taking out the engines, turrets and shield generators of capital ships. It is often favourably compared to the Plasma Cannon, a household standard in the post-realignment Jump Gate network, because it has the higher projectile speed of the two.

This resulted in weapons such as the Blast Mortar: surprisingly simple to produce, at least from the perspective of the superior Paranid intellect, yet at the same time brutally effective. Though they were initially ordered to build stronger beams for their visual effect, the priest engineers put their faith in what they most believed in: local maxima in the parameter space. Like a paradise yet untouched by mortal interference, the Blast Mortar works in perfect equilibrium as long as its careful calibration isn't disturbed.

It is often considered the logical next step after having familiarised oneself with the Pulse Laser.

This means that the pilot needs to have experience in gauging when to expend their burst, and when to let the weapon cool down and wait for a better opportunity. When facing off against this weapon, nimble ships may be able to dodge its stream of bullets by strafing and making spiral movements. Against capital ships, the Bolt Repeater is a suitable choice for destroying surface elements such as turrets and shields, though it struggles to leave a lasting impact on the ship's hull.\n\nThe modern-day Bolt Repeater is the result of a development path taken by Argon military scientists from old Mass Driver designs; a weapon which first saw use during the era of the Kha'ak threat. By stripping out the original weapon's ability to penetrate shields, and instead maximising the force of its continuous bullet output, they created a robust all-rounder that was soon adopted by the Federation's allies because of its sheer brutal efficiency.\n\nThe Mk2 variant uses even larger projectiles while maintaining the same projectile speed, resulting in a lower rate of fire but an increased level of overall trauma to the target's hull and shields.",500,119121,132356,145592,,32.0,32.0,10.0,0.0,2400.0,0.0,3000.0,55.0,2000.0,1.13,123.9,320.0,320.0

This niche ability comes at a cost, however: its short range and low energy output against the main shield and hull of its target make the Burst Ray an ineffective weapon for skirmishes with small and medium-sized ships. In a pinch, the fact that the individual beams deliver their damage instantaneously, may nevertheless prove useful against small and evasive targets.\n\nIt is said that the Priest Duke of Pious Mists himself ordered the development of a specialised anti-capital ship weapon to counter the overreliance on heavy fleets and long-range weaponry of the Holy Order of the Pontifex.\n\nThe Mk2 variant fires more often per burst, which increases the energy output significantly.

Heat accumulates almost instantaneously when the trigger is engaged, after which the pilot can release the shot immediately or take their time to aim. These unique features come at a cost, however: the weapon is mounted in a fixed forward-facing orientation, which makes automatic target tracking impossible and means that the pilot has to rely solely on their own skill. Over an extended period of time, the energy output of this weapon may appear relatively poor, but its strength lies in the initial attack, which can surprise the target and take out vital systems before a skirmish. It is therefore most commonly used in a combined arms approach, to support an already engaged force. On fast and nimble ships, which can reliably keep their opponents at a distance, the weapon's superior range may also allow the pilot to defeat their opponent without ever coming under fire themselves.\n\nThis weapon is not to be confused with pre-Shutdown versions of the Mass Driver, which fired constant streams of shield-penetrating projectiles. The militaries of both the Argon Federation and the Godrealm of the Paranid attempted to improve on the old design, and both developed weapons that now bear little resemblance to the original.

Similar to other high precision weapons, the Meson Stream does not automatically track its target, and relies on the pilot's skill for aiming. In other respects, including its moderate range, it handles more similarly to beam weapons such as the Beam Emitter. The Meson Stream does not require charging, and can theoretically be fired without releasing the trigger. However, the ship's maximum heat capacity will usually prevent this kind of usage. Because of the weapon's extreme power consumption and heat generation, it can only be attached to high-energy weapon mounts.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, the Terran military had long since toyed with the idea of an oversized laser cannon. Despite requiring an entirely new, specialised platform, and bearing an abysmally wasteful energy profile, such a weapon's potential as a deterrent was never in question. Moreover, superweapons maintain a special place in the heart of Terran popular culture, and when the time came to develop the first small-scale prototype, there was overwhelming public support for the project. In light of this, the Meson Stream represented the first cautious, yet determined, steps of the Terran Protectorate towards fulfilling a long-harboured fantasy.\n\nIn return for massively increased material cost, the Mk2 variant manages to raise the energy output of the weapon to an even higher level.",500,2367396,2785171,3202947,,5675.0,5675.0,0.0,0.0,299792500.0,0.0,299792500.0,3000.0,500.0,0.13,100.0,0.0,0.0

weapon_tel_s_charge_01_mk2_macro,Muon Charger Mk2,weapon,s,2,"The Muon Charger is a short range, high damage weapon. Its unusual handling requires the pilot to manually charge every shot. It is recommended that it only be used when fully charged, as the damage potential is otherwise greatly reduced. Upon release, it fires multiple bolts, with a relatively small spread, which are able to stick to a target and deal damage over time. Earlier iterations had an issue with the priming of the weapon, causing some of its projectiles to ricochet harmlessly. This has since been rectified, improving the reliability of this weapon in the heat of battle. If used correctly, the Muon Charger will never overheat, allowing for a continuous and consistent damage output.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance Science Division developed this weapon for all-round use, though arguably it can be difficult to deploy effectively in dogfights against fast targets. The ability to hold the charge and release at will was intended to give pilots more control over their weapon, and increase the fighter fleet's accuracy statistics. The unique characteristics of this weapon, however, mean that custom training is required, making it unsuitable for the Ministry's novice fighter program.\n\nThe Mk2 variant offers increased damage output.",500,35426,54179,72932,,176.0,176.0,3.0,0.0,1571.0,0.0,2356.5,75.0,2000.0,1.13,58.0,528.0,528.0

Similar to the Bolt Repeater, the constant stream of projectiles travels rather slowly and requires aiming ahead in order to hit moving targets. The Neutron Gatling is renowned for its high damage output, but the low accuracy and noticeable spread can make hitting small targets at range rather challenging, forcing pilots to close the distance. For the dogfight-loving Split this is considered part of the hunt.\n\nThe Split developed this weapon, taking into account the psychological effects on the pilot and target. While the pilot feels empowered by commanding a high rate of fire over a prolonged time, the target feels terrorised by the light show and left to guess which projectiles might hit or miss. Despite not being part of the intended design, the low accuracy helps pirates to intimidate their prey without noticeably damaging their prize. It is a functional weapon for combat, but arguably also a tool to express the Split warrior culture and spread terror among their many foes.\n\nThe Mk2 variant offers increased damage output and a higher rate of fire.",500,78181,127292,176404,,12.0,12.0,23.0,0.0,2160.0,0.0,2700.0,31.0,2000.0,1.13,123.9,276.0,276.0
weapon_gen_s_plasma_01_mk2_macro,Plasma Cannon Mk2,weapon,s,2,"The Plasma Cannon combines high damage output with long range. Its drawbacks, slow projectile speed and fire rate, made worse by high heat generation, can make landing hits as challenging as it is important. This results in its predominant use being against capital ships, where swarms of fighters deploy Plasma Cannons to great success. Unlike short ranged weapons such as the Shard Battery and the Split Tau Accelerator, which outperform it in damage output and are more suited to attacking capital ships from a blind spot, the Plasma Cannon's greatest advantage is its range. Skilled pilots are also able to hunt down smaller targets efficiently, either by deploying the Plasma Cannon at short range or by predicting the courses of the projectile and target. Similarly, skilled pilots are also able to evade and avoid being hit by such attempts.\n\nThe Plasma Cannon was developed during the early days of the Paranid Civil War, by the Holy Order of the Pontifex, building upon the High Energy Plasma Thrower. Like its predecessor, it suffers from high radiation build-up, and this needs to be purged between shots to prevent it from damaging itself. The blueprint for the Plasma Cannon was stolen by the Argon Secret Service and distributed throughout the Commonwealth when the Argon Federation joined the war effort.\n\nThe Mk2 variant has a higher rate of fire, lower heat generation and increased damage output.",500,55827,62030,68233,,1331.0,1331.0,0.0,0.0,1229.0,0.0,4055.7,3414.0,2000.0,1.13,47.4,0.0,0.0

It is considered the Terran high-energy variant of the Commonwealth Bolt Repeater. Compared to the Bolt Repeater, the Proton Barrage offers higher damage output and projectile speed, but forfeits some of its range. While providing more damage in total, the Barrage has a lower fire rate and focusses on delivering more powerful individual projectiles during its long bursts. Its main downsides are its compatibility restriction that limits it to Terran ship designs, and the fact that it is twice as expensive when compared to the weaker Commonwealth Bolt Repeater. The Proton Barrage is a generalist weapon which performs well against most reasonable targets.\n\nWith the reconnection of the Commonwealth, the Terran Secret Service acquired the Bolt Repeater blueprint, enabling Terran engineers to develop it into the Proton Barrage. They adjusted it for Terran high-energy mount compatibility, effectively increasing its power, while also preventing the Commonwealth from using it.\n\nThe Mk2 variant increases the damage output, despite reducing the rate of fire, by making the individual projectiles more powerful still.",500,486903,572827,658751,,95.0,95.0,3.3,0.0,3600.0,0.0,2646.0,161.0,2000.0,1.13,120.0,313.5,313.5
weapon_gen_s_laser_01_mk2_macro,Pulse Laser Mk2,weapon,s,2,"Many experienced pilots fondly remember the affordable and reliable Pulse Laser as their first weapon. Its pin-point accuracy and high projectile speed make it an excellent choice for fighting small and fast targets, handling fragile lockboxes, and for dealing with deployables like mines and laser towers. Often initially scoffed at for its comparatively low damage output, its slow heat generation and sublime cooling result in a steady stream of disruptive fire, which in turn rewards pilots who can stay on target for an extended period. Faced with larger enemies, the Pulse Laser does not become obsolete as quickly as one might expect. Used in greater numbers, it can still be a formidable choice against frigates and corvettes, though an upgrade to a larger weapon mount may be advisable to maintain a level playing field. The Pulse Laser remains the preferred choice of commanders who favour versatility over optimisation against specific opponents, or who have little trust in the aim of their subordinates.\n\nThe technology behind the Pulse Laser is advanced and efficient. Within a shielded chamber, microscopic fragments of matter are superheated and accelerated by a pulsed neodymium laser. The weapon was originally designed by the Ministry of Finance to provide a robust loadout for their escort fleets, without having to invest time and resources into the maintenance of a well-rounded combined arms setup. Over time, and thanks to the Teladi Company's aggressive marketing, it has been adopted as the number one weapon of convenience by all other former members of the Community of Planets.\n\nThe Mk2 variant sports a slightly longer burst.

weapon_ter_s_laser_01_mk2_macro,Pulse Laser Mk2,weapon,s,2,"Although it bears the same name as the most widely available weapon in the Jump Gate network, the Terran Pulse Laser functions in a slightly different way. It dispenses with the use of clips for short bursts, and puts a greater emphasis on the power of the individual projectiles. Despite the weapon's reduced effective range, the microscopic particles are accelerated faster and reach their targets much quicker. Heat, therefore, accumulates more quickly than for its non-Terran counterpart, but because of the supreme energy efficiency of the underlying mechanism, overheating remains an unlikely event. As such, pilots who use this version of the Pulse Laser are still rewarded for maintaining pressure on their opponents, and remaining on target for the entirety of the fight.\n\nAfter the Realignment, the Terran Protectorate was quick to survey the military capabilities of its potential rivals in the new Jump Gate network, and soon acquired blueprints for the most widespread weapon of the time - the Pulse Laser. Noticing its versatility and beautiful simplicity, the well-oiled machine of the Terran military-industrial complex did what it had always done best: made extensive adjustments to auspicious technology to give it a distinct Terran identity and to prevent reverse-engineering. The result still behaves like a Pulse Laser in practice. Although initially it was deemed unusable by foreign powers, defying all predictions, the Pulse Laser has been retrofitted onto many other ships with only minimal compromise.\n\nThe Mk2 variant greatly improves the weapon's energy output and rate of fire, while only marginally raising its rate of heat accumulation.",500,180862,212779,244696,,99.0,99.0,2.3,0.0,6220.8,0.0,2737.152,127.0,2000.0,1.13,160.0,227.7,227.7
weapon_gen_s_shotgun_01_mk2_macro,Shard Battery Mk2,weapon,s,2,"The Shard Battery is essentially a spaceborne shotgun, that makes up for its low effective range and accuracy by inflicting devastating trauma against shields and hull alike. At its core, it is functionally similar to the Bolt Repeater that it was originally developed from. However, the ejection of multiple projectiles at once requires a wider barrel aperture, a larger spacing between shots, and generates a higher energy drain. When it comes to its damage output, the Shard Battery has been compared to the Plasma Cannon, but it offers a slightly different range of applications. Skilled military pilots may occasionally make use of this weapon against small targets in an attempt to end the fight quickly, but it is generally agreed upon that one should try to avoid these situations. The Shard Battery reaches its fullest potential against larger and slower targets such as M-sized ships, which cannot as easily evade its projectiles. It is also especially effective against capital ship surface elements, provided that the pilot can find an opportunity to target them from the blind spots of nearby turrets.\n\nThe Mk2 variant fires fewer shards at a higher speed but with a shorter interval. This raises the overall damage output and improves the weapon's accuracy, especially against more nimble targets, but in turn incurs a quicker heat build-up.",500,135242,150269,165296,,95.0,95.0,1.25,0.0,3456.0,0.0,2305.152,244.0,2000.0,1.13,107.0,118.75,118.75

For Split bounty hunters, the profession in which the use of this weapon remains the most prevalent, these apparent drawbacks are entirely immaterial.
