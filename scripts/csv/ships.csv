For nearly four decades, the inhabitants largely had to make do with an aging fleet of stranded ships that were taken by surprise by the Jump Gate shutdown. The few remaining engineers in the system were mainly occupied with maintenance, but experimented when they could with custom ship designs. They slowly learned the craft, and became creative with the resources they had to hand. Most of their custom creations were built from repurposed luxury mass traffic vehicles, spare engines disassembled from the leftover fleet, and various parts from scrapped ships that were beyond repair.

The first ships to transport food to Avarice, and building materials to Windfall, were mostly ancient relics from before the Dark. These ships were quickly left inoperable by the actions of pirates, and were replaced by the Raleigh, a courier developed at the Aurora Casino. Soon afterwards, the Alliance of the Word's Wharf began operations, and started producing Commonwealth transporters. It took the Solid Ice Union, a worker conglomerate of ice miners, until 823 (NT) to complete development of their own freighter, the Barbarossa. With its high speed and decent number of turrets, Solid Ice Union captains in their freighters would soon come to dominate the trade between Windfall and Avarice, fending off piracy and even attacking other freighters to fill up their own cargo holds.\n\nAfter designing the Barbarossa, Solid Ice Union engineers attempted to develop a destroyer, but lacked the required knowledge to design its weapon systems. These attempts were cut short by a moratorium imposed by the Syndicate, who distrusted the already well-armed Solid Ice Union, and threatened a civil war should they attempt to militarise further.",l,scavenger,ship_l,fight,114000,243.18,5382530,7714025,10045520,0,160,0,10,126,argon,3,12,2,10,6,33,86.42,180.0,180.0,104.034

For decades they had worked together to maintain an aging fleet of ice miners, of various Commonwealth designs, which were left stranded during the Dark. With a monopoly on food production and ice mining, it was imperative that they incorporated all capital ships in the system into their fleets, whether as working vessels or by scrapping them for parts. After the connection, they were the only faction in Windfall still capable of making full use of capital ships, and were unwavering in defending their mining rights against any newcomers.\n\nOnce the steady supply of resources from Avarice allowed the mass production of ships to restart, the Solid Ice Union began construction of a shipyard. At the same time, they started development of their own ice miner, the Donia. They drew on their experience with a broad range of ice miners, and their intricate knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of now-dated Commonwealth designs.

ship_pir_l_scrapper_01_macro,Teuta,"With the advent of the Dark, Avarice was forced to rely on a fleet of stranded ships that had been taken by surprise by the Jump Gate shutdown. Despite the almost immediate collapse of the Avarice company, capable scientists and engineers soon took it upon themselves to stabilise the system and work towards sustainability. They first established a functioning wharf for repairs and replacement, and conducted early experiments into developing a recycling economy in anticipation of dwindling resources within the system. The regeneration of this post-shutdown economy was quickly curtailed by the first Tides, which destroyed most stations and ships in the system in 800 (NT). However, a side-effect of the destructive solar event was the greatly increased energy output from solar panels, which allowed for a paradigm shift. The new Rakers economy emerging from Tidebreak, at the time the only station in Avarice, took advantage of this new abundance of energy. This, along with the use of local wrecks, enabled the rebuilding of a new, sustainable, closed-loop economy based on recycling, allowing them to further improve on previous ship and station module designs. Resettlement of Avarice began in 818 (NT), when the Northriver Company introduced Protectyon and the associated Protectyon Shield Generators to safeguard stations from the Tide. A few years later, in 825 (NT), the reconnection of Windfall gave the long-isolated Rakers the opportunity to trade with various Syndicate factions, but also exposed them to their piracy.(Avarice Ship Building)\n\n(Teuta)With the introduction of the large scale recycling economy required for the resettlement of Avarice, Tidebreak's engineers were soon looking for ways to break down and reclaim resources from wrecks that were too big for Tug ships to tow, and for Scrap Processors to process.

ship_gen_m_tugboat_01_a_macro,Manticore,"With the advent of the Dark, Avarice was forced to rely on a fleet of stranded ships that had been taken by surprise by the Jump Gate shutdown. Despite the almost immediate collapse of the Avarice company, capable scientists and engineers soon took it upon themselves to stabilise the system and work towards sustainability. They first established a functioning wharf for repairs and replacement, and conducted early experiments into developing a recycling economy in anticipation of dwindling resources within the system. The regeneration of this post-shutdown economy was quickly curtailed by the first Tides, which destroyed most stations and ships in the system in 800 (NT). However, a side-effect of the destructive solar event was the greatly increased energy output from solar panels, which allowed for a paradigm shift. The new Rakers economy emerging from Tidebreak, at the time the only station in Avarice, took advantage of this new abundance of energy. This, along with the use of local wrecks, enabled the rebuilding of a new, sustainable, closed-loop economy based on recycling, allowing them to further improve on previous ship and station module designs. Resettlement of Avarice began in 818 (NT), when the Northriver Company introduced Protectyon and the associated Protectyon Shield Generators to safeguard stations from the Tide. A few years later, in 825 (NT), the reconnection of Windfall gave the long-isolated Rakers the opportunity to trade with various Syndicate factions, but also exposed them to their piracy.(Avarice Ship Building)\n\n(Manticore)With the Jump Gate shutdown disconnecting Avarice the first Tug ship, a predecessor of the Manticore, was quickly developed by stranded Argon engineers to tug small ship wrecks to stations for further processing and make best use of the now very limited access to resources. With just one of those ships and their first version of the Scrap Processor and Scrap Recycler modules they ran a small enterprise with a high demand for energy and a slow output of Hull Parts and Claytronics. It was only after the first Tide destroyed most stations and ships in the system in 800 (NT) that their blueprints became the main pillar of Rakers economy and were further developed into the now widely used Manticore, utilising more powerful engines, and station modules. After messenger drones from Sacred Relic arrived, the people of Avarice themselves sent out messenger drones containing the blueprints to other disconnected systems, hoping to help those unfortunate enough to be stranded with no natural resources in reach. In doing this they created a local branch of the Alliance of the Word operating from Tidebreak.

ship_par_m_trans_container_03_a_macro,Prometheus,"The gradual Shutdown of the Jump Gates and the subsequent onset of the Dark shattered the shadowy organisation once known as the Duke's Buccaneers. Those that remained stalwart in their loyalty to the Pirate Duke had to rapidly adapt their operations to not be squashed under the heel of the newly emerging local authorities, or worse, fade into obscurity. Faced with the challenge to justify their further existence as an organisation, the majority of Buccaneer cells defaulted to the front they had already used for decades: the brutal, but dependable security outfit. Under this old and new guise, they acquired some renown transporting crucial personnel and wares for reconstruction and redevelopment. They also dealt in protection, corporate consulting, and other stunningly legal services. The support of well-equipped muscle proved useful for the leadership of the many societies that now struggled in isolation, and over the decades, the Buccaneers managed to refine their technology to suit the requirements of their new area of employment.\n\nThe Prometheus heavy transport is a relatively new addition to the arsenal of the Duke's Buccaneers, developed specifically to carry the lessons learned during the Dark into the era after the Realignment of the Jump Gates. Its hull is based on the Plutus, a well-known Paranid mining vessel. While earlier iterations of Buccaneer transport ships were often in fact civilian assets retrofitted for convenience, the design of the Prometheus is deliberate and insidious. Unless they were paying specific attention, any onlooker would simply see a mining ship, well-prepared for the dangers lurking at the edges of civilised space. On approach, such a hapless passerby or opportunistic brigand would soon realise that the inconspicuous hauler was in fact a well-armed pirate ship, perfectly equipped for a quick plunder.

ship_pir_xl_battleship_01_a_macro,Erlking,"With the advent of the Dark, Avarice was forced to rely on a fleet of stranded ships that had been taken by surprise by the Jump Gate shutdown. Despite the almost immediate collapse of the Avarice company, capable scientists and engineers soon took it upon themselves to stabilise the system and work towards sustainability. They first established a functioning wharf for repairs and replacement, and conducted early experiments into developing a recycling economy in anticipation of dwindling resources within the system. The regeneration of this post-shutdown economy was quickly curtailed by the first Tides, which destroyed most stations and ships in the system in 800 (NT). However, a side-effect of the destructive solar event was the greatly increased energy output from solar panels, which allowed for a paradigm shift. The new Rakers economy emerging from Tidebreak, at the time the only station in Avarice, took advantage of this new abundance of energy. This, along with the use of local wrecks, enabled the rebuilding of a new, sustainable, closed-loop economy based on recycling, allowing them to further improve on previous ship and station module designs. Resettlement of Avarice began in 818 (NT), when the Northriver Company introduced Protectyon and the associated Protectyon Shield Generators to safeguard stations from the Tide. A few years later, in 825 (NT), the reconnection of Windfall gave the long-isolated Rakers the opportunity to trade with various Syndicate factions, but also exposed them to their piracy.(Avarice Ship Building)\n\n(Erlking Shielded against Tide)Shortly after the first Tides in 800 (NT) devastated the Avarice system, nomad engineers on Tidebreak, under their lead engineer Sihi Do, began the Erlking project. This project was an attempt at building a capital ship, sturdy enough to withstand the Tide and be used as a mobile base in Avarice. No sooner had they succeeded in providing the ship with sufficient shielding, than they abandoned all work on the barely operational Erlking. They refocused their attention on another, undisclosed, major project, before ultimately disappearing. Despite being unfinished, the Erlking continued to be deployed, while Tidebreak engineers repeatedly attempted, and failed, to improve on, or even reproduce, the design's unique power core.\n\nWith the connection of Avarice to the more militarised Syndicate system in 821 (NT), Tidebreak engineers attempted to weaponise the Erlking, and reclassified it as Battleship. They added turret and weapon hard-points, but failed to develop compatible turrets and weapons. The Syndicate later confiscated the ship to remove this potential military threat, and attempted to develop the weapon systems themselves. Among the engineers of Windfall, those of the Solid Ice Union had the most experience with capital ships, but the political situation, and fear of a power grab, meant that they were not allowed to work on the Erlking. Instead, the Scrapyard engineers were tasked with completing the weapon systems. Having previously failed to stabilise the energy supply on the Shih fighter, to increase the number of supported weapons, the Erlking presented them with the opposite problem: all efforts to connect conventional weaponry to its unique power grid resulted in them being blown off the hull.
