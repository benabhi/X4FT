missile_emp_mk1,missile_emp_mk1_macro,EMP Missile Mk1,"Known by some pilots as the Hamstring, the EMP is a highly specialised, vessel-disabling missile system frequently used by law enforcement ships for non-lethal interdiction missions. With a powerful matter/antimatter reaction engine, and a highly specialised warhead, this weapon can reach top speeds well in excess of that of common ship travel drives. When it reaches its target, it sheds the protective outer shell and exposes an elaborate antenna array, which it uses to accurately aim and discharge a powerful electromagnetic pulse. The effect of this pulse is a prompt shutdown of the target ship's travel drive, which makes the law enforcement vessel's task of catching up significantly easier. Using a combination of extremely accurate radar, and computer-based prediction algorithms carried out before launch, the weapon works by predicting an impact point from a straight line approach rather than attempting to chase down the target via curves and turns like most other weapons. It is worth noting that, with the extreme speeds provided by the Peregrine engine system, the Hamstring can be a difficult beast to control.",missile,,1,808,950,1093,"equipment,missile"

While the damage caused to each individual target is naturally significantly less than could be achieved with a unitary charge, cluster-munitions, packing sufficiently powerful sub-munitions, can provide a pilot with the means to quickly disable a hostile target by taking out key components.\n\nLike the dumbfire-type munitions, the cluster-based weapon does not possess the means to compensate for changes in the target's trajectory. Target data from the ship's onboard computer systems is used to program a timer moments before the weapon's launch. Once the timer reaches its end, ideally moments before the missile impacts, a plethora of smart mini-bombs or ""bomblets"" are dispersed around the target area. These feature fairly advanced homing software to enable them to seek out the more vulnerable parts of the exposed systems of an enemy combatant.\n\nThe Heavy Cluster weapon represents a considerable step up in terms of destructive capability, while sacrificing thrust-to-weight ratio, compared to its smaller counterpart.

missile_guided_heavy_mk1,missile_guided_heavy_mk1_macro,Heavy Guided Missile Mk1,"It was during initial testing that a curious side-effect of a new thruster nozzle would give the ""Banshee"" missile its now iconic nickname. While undergoing power and stability testing, the weapon was fixed in a rig while the rocket motor was fired. The research team found that, at certain settings, the weapon emitted a sound wave that bore an eerie resemblance to the screams of the Banshee, a Terran mythical creature. This issue was eventually tracked down to an improperly configured pressure valve, but by the time a fix had been issued, the name had stuck.\n\nCompared to the Light Guided missiles, the Banshee is significantly slower but carries an absolutely devastating punch. In small salvoes, this is a good weapon to install on a fighter intended to counter heavier corvettes, and potentially even frigates, where the inherent agility advantage of the fighter can help offset the somewhat sluggish nature of this weapon. An upgraded weapon-to-ship data link not only improves the chances of first time contact, but also allows the missile to come around for multiple passes in the event of failure to connect on the first attempt.

missile_heatseeker_heavy_mk1,missile_heatseeker_heavy_mk1_macro,Heavy Heatseeker Missile Mk1,"After evaluating the performance of the Light Heatseeker missile, the design-team responsible for its creation noticed something peculiar. During testing, a significant number of encounters resulted in mission failures that could have been prevented by fitting the missile with just a slightly more powerful warhead. Unfortunately, when the team brought this matter up, politics got in the way and what was intended to be a simple upgrade turned into a weapon so different that it became its own development program entirely.\n\nThis new Heavy Heatseeker weapon, nicknamed the Icarus, is a heat-seeking missile with a powerful warhead capable of dealing significant, possibly even catastrophic, damage to most fighters, heavy fighters and corvettes. While multiple impacts may be required to take out a frigate, the weapon is more than capable of that as well. It is not too agile though and like its smaller cousin, it suffers from the same design compromises on its guidance package, meaning it can be fairly easily defeated by decoys.",missile,,1,2178,2563,2947,"equipment,missile"
missile_scatter_heavy_mk1,missile_scatter_heavy_mk1_macro,Heavy Scatter Missile Mk1,"The Heavy Scatter missile is a two-stage weapon. In order to fit within the fixed dimensions of standard launchers, a compromise had to be found in order to provide a rapid-fire solution using rockets as ammunition in place of ordinary gun systems. The weapon contains a primary stage which consists of an outer, detachable shell and internal wiring as well as the necessary attachment points for housing several individual rockets. Once the weapon has cleared the launcher and the main body is at a safe distance from the ship, the outer shell will detach from the internal rigging into four separate pieces. In a matter of microseconds the smaller individual rockets detach from the internal rigging and their boosters ignite, propelling them towards the target at speed. The weapon behaves much like a very complex shotgun, albeit a shotgun that fires rockets instead of pellets.\n\nUsing a combination of high explosive and incendiary warheads can inflict widespread damage to multiple separate points on an enemy combatant, and is a very effective way of overpowering their damage control capabilities. It is, however, extremely inaccurate and should be used only from point-blank range against L and XL targets.",missile,,1,1078,1268,1458,"equipment,missile"

missile_starburst_heavy_mk1,missile_starburst_heavy_mk1_macro,Heavy Starburst Missile Mk1,"The Starburst, whose name comes from its peculiar warhead, is a missile that embodies the Split mentality of hitting hard. So hard in fact, that by some measures, it carries arguably the most powerful warhead available for any missile weapon shy of a torpedo-class munition. The incredible destructive power of the weapon, along with its classification, has been the source of no small number of legal disputes between the Split, seeking to keep it as a missile for export purposes, and certain non-Split wishing to have it reclassified as a Torpedo for their own benefit.\n\nThe Starburst uses a special kind of fuel, in the form of a continuous rod that extends through almost the entire length of the weapon. This rod serves as both fuel for the engine, and as the source of its destructive potential. The rate of combustion is kept under control by spraying the fuel-rod with a dampener-agent, without which the burn-rate spirals out of control much in the same way as a star going supernova, albeit on a much smaller scale.",missile,,1,1700,2000,2300,"equipment,missile"
missile_swarm_heavy_mk1,missile_swarm_heavy_mk1_macro,Heavy Swarm Missile Mk1,"The bigger sister to the Light Swarm missile, the Heavy Swarm version is also a Paranid weapon system designed to overcome defensive anti-missile measures on a well equipped target. Like its smaller counterpart, the Heavy Swarm missile uses a two-stage solution to achieve this. A larger primary stage consists of an external shell that carries multiple, smaller missiles internally. The outer shell ensures compliance with standardised launchers, and the internally carried sub-missiles are released just a few seconds after launch. At that point, they disperse and follow an infra-red spectrum guidance laser from the launching ship to the intended target. The use of the laser makes the system somewhat cheaper, which helps offset the cost of several guidance sections, but also makes the weapon susceptible to infra-red decoys such as flares.\n\nThe sub-missiles are fitted with fairly powerful high-explosive warheads behind a teladianium disc. When triggered, the teladianium forms into a shape somewhat like a dart. This dart penetrates into the target where it fractures into large, devastating shards of almost molten metal, causing tremendous damage.",missile,,1,1934,2275,2616,"equipment,missile"
missile_torpedo_heavy_mk1,missile_torpedo_heavy_mk1_macro,Heavy Torpedo Missile Mk1,"The Heavy Torpedo missile is more commonly known as the Triton. Torpedoes are significantly slower than other missile weapons but they provide far and away more firepower on impact than any other type. They are best utilised, therefore, against less agile ships and emplacements that cannot easily avoid the impact simply by moving out of the way. Significantly more powerful than the Light Torpedo missile, this weapon is the premier choice against the heaviest and most durable of hostile vessels. No other weapon delivers as much destructive power as the Triton in a single explosive blast. The Triton missile is a hot-launched weapon. This means the rocket motor fires immediately upon button-press and begins its slow, ponderous journey towards the target. This in turn imparts significantly more stress and maintenance costs upon the launcher itself. Like its smaller counterpart, the Light Torpedo missile, the Triton is extremely resilient to countermeasures.",missile,,1,17563,20663,23762,"equipment,missile"

missile_disruptor_light_mk1,missile_disruptor_light_mk1_macro,Light Disruptor Missile Mk1,"The Disruptor missile might be one of the most insidious missile systems currently available. It is likely that the weapon was reverse engineered from the Hamstring EMP-system. While the Hamstring is a non-harmful weapon that causes no lasting damage to the target and leaves the crews unharmed, the Disruptor missile has no such limitations. Using a modified copy of the Hamstring's Peregrine engine, it accelerates to a brisk pace in pursuit of its target. When the missile gets close enough to its target, it brutally attacks, not just with an electromagnetic pulse discharge, but also by allowing its reactor to go critical and subsequently detonate. The electromagnetic pulse is blasted into the target vessel moments before a violent explosion wreaks havoc on its control and guidance systems. This level of interference is enough to trick a target vessel's security protocols into triggering emergency shutdowns of their own propulsion systems, leaving them effectively immobilised for roughly the duration of a short system scan and reboot. Like the Hamstring, the extreme speeds provided by the Peregrine engine system mean that the Disruptor missile can be a difficult to control.",missile,,1,1387,1632,1877,"equipment,missile"

Given the often tightly choreographed Paranid approach to combat manoeuvres, and the frantic nature of dogfights in general, where split-second decisions and actions can have severe consequences, this targeting logic was deemed in accordance with the Holy Three-Dimensionality. Funding for its development was allocated, and what they got in return was a weapon that has virtually no lock-on time requirement whatsoever. That advantage, however, comes at a significant cost to threat-identification and countermeasure burn-through capability. In practice, this means that the weapon is easily foiled by decoys and best used either in massed volleys, often from multiple ships, or in drawn-out engagements in which the enemy's supply of countermeasures is depleted. Naturally, this sort of approach does not sit too well with a military that prides itself on efficiency.\n\nExactly how the blueprints for the Stormbolt found their way to the open markets is unknown, but while the weapon failed to gain traction with the Paranid, other races with a less frugal view on munitions expenditure have since made good use of it.",missile,,1,839,988,1136,"equipment,missile"

While the origins of the system remain shrouded in mystery, it presents a very real and often-lauded tool today, that often sees use in defensive turrets on trade and cargo ships, as well as on defensive installations in various sectors. While the system is primarily intended to be used as a defensive, counter-missile tool, it is also quite capable of warding off potential aggressors.

However, where a full-sized weapon would present a significantly easier interception task for the defensive gun and missile systems on a target vessel, the multiple smaller weapons complicate this, both by increasing the saturation level through sheer numbers but also by being smaller and effectively a harder target to hit. This requires guns to stay longer on target, and defensive missile banks to expend many more shorts to avert an impact.",missile,,1,967,1138,1308,"equipment,missile"
missile_torpedo_light_mk1,missile_torpedo_light_mk1_macro,Light Torpedo Missile Mk1,"Torpedoes are significantly slower than other missile weapons but they provide far and away more firepower on impact than any other type. They are best utilised, therefore, against less agile ships and emplacements that cannot easily avoid the impact simply by moving out of the way. The Light Torpedo missile is a hot-launched weapon. This means the rocket motor fires immediately upon button-press and begins its slow, ponderous journey towards the target. This in turn imparts significantly more stress and maintenance costs upon the launcher itself. With an enlarged launcher comes a larger body which allows significantly more room for explosive mass in the weapon. This torpedo is a two-stage weapon with a powerful high explosive precursor warhead that violently rips a hole in the enemy vessel. A primary charge then detonates and turns the weapon into a massive and extremely damaging fragmentation grenade, more than powerful enough to rip apart most ships in a single blow. The Light Torpedo missile is extremely resilient to countermeasures.",missile,,1,3921,4613,5304,"equipment,missile"
